# MEV relay list for Mainnet

Here is a list of MEV relays for the Ethereum Mainnet network. To add one to your mev-boost configuration, simply copy and paste the *Relay URL* in your `-relays` flag value. You can add multiple relays comma-separated to the `-relays` flag, like this: `-relays https://relay1,https://relay2`. If you are using multiple relays, the current algorithm for mev-boost will select the relay that offers you the most profit.

Selecting your relays **can be an important decision** for some stakers. You should do your own diligence when selecting which relay you want to use.
